/**
 * The recorded spec: a real `fetch()` from inside workerd, served from a
 * committed cassette.
 *
 * What this pins is the **transport**, not any particular API. The cassette is
 * hand-written and the host is obviously synthetic, because the thing under test
 * is that the VCR recorder is installed at all — and this fails loudly if it
 * ever stops being. That has happened before, in core, when the pool removed the
 * `fetchMock` option and an unknown key under `miniflare` was ignored rather
 * than rejected. Nothing noticed until a consumer saw
 * `internal error; reference = …` naming nothing.
 *
 * Do not add a suite here that records a real model call. Core's VCR *throws*
 * on a missing cassette rather than skipping, so a suite whose cassette cannot
 * be committed keeps `npm test` and CI red. Model-call coverage belongs where it
 * runs without credentials: the unit specs against core's `mock-model`.
